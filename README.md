# chesscpp
C++ chess engine + python interface

## Why?
* I like chess, although I rarely play it nowadays.
* I want to experience a complete chess engine development cycle, from implementing the first version of representation and move rules to eventually optimizing the whole thing and finally embedding some Neural Network AI into it. Why? because
* To have some project to fallback to if I'm bored.
